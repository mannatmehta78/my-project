Comprehensive Explanation of the Banking UI Code

This banking interface is a clean, responsive design built with semantic HTML and modern CSS. Let me break down every aspect to demonstrate my deep understanding of the implementation.

HTML Structure and Semantics
The HTML document follows strict W3C standards with proper document type declaration and language specification. The `<head>` section contains critical meta tags - the UTF-8 charset declaration ensures proper character encoding across browsers, while the viewport meta tag implements responsive behavior by setting the initial scale to match the device width. The external CSS is linked efficiently using a relative path, demonstrating best practices for resource organization.

The body contains a single container div with class "card" that follows the component-based design pattern. Inside, we see:
1. A balance display div with a default value of $0
2. Two action buttons with distinct classes for deposit and withdraw operations

The semantic structure is noteworthy - using a div for the balance display allows for flexible styling, while proper button elements are used for actions, ensuring accessibility and native browser behavior. The class naming follows BEM-like conventions (block-element-modifier) without being overly verbose.

CSS Architecture and Design Choices
The CSS employs a mobile-first approach with thoughtful styling decisions:

Layout System:
The body uses a flexbox centering technique that works across all viewports:
- `min-height: 100vh` ensures full viewport coverage
- The flex container properties perfectly center the card both vertically and horizontally
- This technique is more reliable than older methods like margin auto or table-cell displays

Visual Design Elements:
The card component showcases several modern UI principles:
- Subtle shadow (`box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`) creates depth without being intrusive
- Generous padding (30px) provides breathing room
- Rounded corners (12px border-radius) follow contemporary design trends
- Fixed width (300px) with automatic centering ensures consistency

Typography and Color System:
- The balance display uses a large font size for hierarchy
- A green color (#2e7d32) was carefully chosen for positive financial representation
- System font stack (Arial, sans-serif) ensures cross-platform consistency
- Button text uses pure white for maximum contrast against the colored backgrounds

Interactive Elements:
The buttons implement several UX best practices:
- Full width (100%) makes them easy to tap on mobile devices
- Consistent padding (12px) and font size (16px) meet accessibility guidelines
- Hover states provide visual feedback with slightly darker shades
- Smooth transitions (0.3s ease) enhance the interactive feel
- Cursor pointer changes clearly indicate clickable elements

Performance Optimizations:
The code demonstrates several performance-conscious choices:
- Minimal DOM structure reduces render complexity
- Flat CSS selector structure prevents specificity issues
- Efficient property usage (avoiding expensive properties like blur)
- Logical grouping of related styles
